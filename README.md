# fingerjoint tool for rhino

This tool takes a different approach to generating fingerjoined planes.  Start with a box comprised of planes whose edges fully overlap.  I designed this model in Autodesk Inventor.

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmOKhCwasbA for a video of the tool in action.

Great when combined with RhinoNest!
